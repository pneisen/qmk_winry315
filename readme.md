# Custom keymap for winry315

I bought this macro pad on AliExpress under the brand name SpiderIsland Tech Co, but I have also seen other names. 

It is a square pad with 15 keys and 3 rotory encoders.

My custom keymap includes 3 layers that the bottom left key (if the encoders are up) toggle through. Each layer has a different solid RGB backlight.
