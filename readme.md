# Custom QMK firmware keymap for winry315

I bought this macro pad on AliExpress under the brand name SpiderIsland Tech Co, but I have also seen other names including Da vinci. 

It is a square macro pad with 15 keys and 3 rotory encoders.

My custom keymap includes 3 layers that the bottom left key (if the encoders are north) toggle through. Each layer has a different solid RGB backlight. Most keys are set to a Fkey or a modified Fkey for hotkey mapping in the OS. The large encoder controls volume. I do have mappings for system sleep and to put the pad in bootloader mode for flashing.
